# First class syntax?

----------

"First-class" in programming languages refers to entities (like functions) that can be treated as values. They can be:

1. Assigned to variables
1. Passed as arguments to other functions
1. Returned from functions
1. Stored in data structures

In JavaScript, functions have always been first-class citizens. 
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced several features that enhanced this first-class nature and made working with functions more convenient. 
Here are some key "first-class" features in ES6:

Arrow Functions:
javascriptCopyconst add = (a, b) => a + b;

Enhanced Object Literals:
```js
javascriptCopyconst obj = {
  method() { /* ... */ }
};

```

Default Parameters:
```js
javascriptCopyfunction greet(name = "Guest") {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

Rest Parameters:
```js
javascriptCopyfunction sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
```

Spread Operator:
```js
javascriptCopyconst arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5];
```

Destructuring Assignment:
```js
javascriptCopyconst [a, b] = [1, 2];
const { x, y } = { x: 10, y: 20 };
```

Classes:
```js
javascriptCopyclass Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}`);
  }
}
```

Modules:
```js
javascriptCopy// In one file
export function myFunction() { /* ... */ }
```

// In another file
```js
import { myFunction } from './myModule';
```

These features make it easier to work with functions and objects as first-class citizens, 
allowing for more expressive and concise code. 
They enhance the ability to pass around and manipulate functions and data structures, 
which is a key aspect of functional programming paradigms.
